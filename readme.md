# üåü Arcane Elemental Game

A browser-based coding adventure built with **Django**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Players harness elemental magic by writing small JavaScript snippets to solve programming ‚Äútrials,‚Äù earn XP & runes, unlock quests, and level up their magical prowess!

## üöÄ Features

* **Elemental Trials**
  Write JavaScript to wield Water, Air, Earth, and Fire in puzzle-like coding challenges.

* **AI-Driven Evaluation**
  Submissions are semantically compared to canonical solutions via an LLM (Groq + LLaMA-3.3-70B), scoring on logic rather than text.

* **Progression & Rewards**
  Earn XP to level up skills per element, and collect runes (in-game currency) for perfect or near-perfect solutions.

* **Hints System**
  Spend runes to buy contextual hints for each trial; hints persist across sessions.

* **Quest Campaign**
  Complete a series of branching quests, each with multiple objectives (loops, conditionals, recursion, data structures).

* **Interactive UI**
  Tailwind-powered responsive design, draggable world map overlay, NPC dialogue panels, and history drawers.

* **Leaderboard & Profiles**
  View top scores by element, inspect your skills progression, and customize your avatar.

## ü§ñ Code Evaluation

* **Semantic Matching**:

  * Parse to ASTs, normalize unordered structures, alpha-rename, constant-fold, detect equivalent control flow.
  * Prompt strictly returns `{"similarity": X}`.

* **Scoring**:

  * Similarity √ó 1000 (min 0, max 1000).
  * ‚â• 0.75 (750) is a pass, awards up to 40 runes linearly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Admin & Customization

* Edit JSON fixtures for bulk data: `elements.json`, `regions.json`, `trials.json`, `trial_solutions.json`, `dialogues.json`, `quests.json`, `questobjectives.json`, `skills.json`.
